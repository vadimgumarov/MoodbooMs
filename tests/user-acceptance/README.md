# User Acceptance Testing (UAT) Guide

## Overview
This directory contains comprehensive user acceptance test scenarios for MoodBooMs to ensure the app meets real-world user expectations and handles various usage patterns gracefully.

## Test Categories
- **New User Journey** - First-time setup and onboarding
- **Daily Usage** - Typical day-to-day interactions
- **Data Management** - Import/export and settings
- **Edge Cases** - Unusual cycles and error conditions
- **Platform-Specific** - macOS/Windows/Linux testing
- **Accessibility** - Screen reader and keyboard navigation
- **Performance** - Responsiveness and memory usage
- **Regression** - Ensuring previous bugs don't return

## How to Use These Tests

### Pre-Testing Setup
1. **Clean Environment**: Fresh app installation or reset all data
2. **Test Data**: Use provided test datasets for consistency
3. **Documentation**: Record all results with screenshots
4. **Platform**: Test on target platforms (macOS primary)

### Test Execution
1. **Follow Steps Exactly**: Execute each step as documented
2. **Record Results**: Pass/Fail with details
3. **Screenshot Issues**: Capture visual problems
4. **Note Performance**: Timing and responsiveness
5. **Accessibility Check**: Test with assistive technologies

## Test Data Sets
All test scenarios use standardized data sets for consistency. See `test-data.yaml` for complete specifications.

## Automation Integration
While these are manual tests, they complement our automated test suite:
- **Unit Tests**: Verify individual functions work correctly
- **Component Tests**: Ensure UI components render properly  
- **E2E Tests**: Validate critical user flows automatically
- **Performance Tests**: Monitor app responsiveness
- **UAT**: Verify real-world user experience

## Quality Gates
