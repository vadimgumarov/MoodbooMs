2025-07-27 10:34: Fixed Production Crashes and Icon Implementation
------------------------------------------------------------
Resolved critical production issues that prevented app from running:

PRODUCTION FIXES IMPLEMENTED:

1. GPU Process Crashes (Exit Code 15):
   - Problem: Renderer process crashed after ~40 seconds with GPU errors
   - Solution: Added app.disableHardwareAcceleration() in main.js
   - Result: App now runs stable without crashes

2. CSP Blocking React in Production:
   - Problem: Content Security Policy blocked React's inline scripts
   - Solution: Added 'unsafe-inline' to script-src in production CSP
   - Technical: React production build requires inline scripts to function

3. React Build Path Issues:
   - Problem: React build used absolute paths (/static/js/...) incompatible with file://
   - Solution: Added "homepage": "./" to package.json
   - Result: Build now uses relative paths that work with Electron

4. Phase Updates Not Working:
   - Problem: React useEffect wasn't firing phase updates in production
   - Solution: Added isLoading check to prevent updates during initialization
   - Result: Tray icons now update correctly when changing test mode

ICON IMPLEMENTATION:

Successfully implemented PNG icon loading for menubar:
- Created iconFromPNG.js module using nativeImage.createFromPath()
- Icons load from electron/assets/icons/ directory
- macOS template image support via setTemplateImage(true)
- All 6 phase icons working: sun, cloud-sun, cloud, cloud-rain-wind, cloud-lightning, tornado

Icon Mapping:
- "Bloody Hell Week" → cloud-lightning.png
- "Finally Got My Sh*t Together" → sun.png
- "Horny AF" → cloud-sun.png
- "Getting Real Tired of This BS" → cloud.png
- "Pre-Chaos Mood Swings" → cloud-rain-wind.png
- "Apocalypse Countdown" → tornado.png

TECHNICAL DISCOVERIES:
- SVG data URLs don't work with macOS menubar (createFromDataURL returns empty)
- PNG files work reliably with createFromPath()
- Production debugging requires extensive logging due to limited DevTools access
- React build configuration crucial for Electron compatibility

Files Modified:
- package.json (added homepage)
- electron/main.js (disabled hardware acceleration)
- electron/csp-config.js (fixed production CSP)
- src/components/MenuBarApp.jsx (fixed phase updates)
- electron/iconFromPNG.js (new - PNG icon loader)
- electron/trayManager.js (switched to PNG icons)

Testing:
- Created launch-menu.sh script for consistent testing
- Added comprehensive logging for production debugging
- Verified all crashes resolved
- Confirmed icons update dynamically

Result: Production app now runs stable with dynamic PNG icons that match the React app exactly.

Result: Clean separation between production code and tests

2025-07-26 07:52: Tray Icon Investigation
------------------------------------------------------------
Investigation into why icons don't work on macOS 15.5:
- Confirmed this is a macOS Sequoia (15.x) compatibility issue
- All image loading methods fail (direct path, nativeImage, base64)
- Icons always return empty (0x0 size) even for valid PNG files
- User briefly saw question mark icon (macOS's missing icon indicator)
- System refuses to load any image files for tray icons
- Created GitHub issue #49 to track this problem

Findings:
- This appears to be an OS-level restriction/bug
- Other Electron apps also affected (1Password, etc.)
- Only workaround is text-based tray using setTitle()
- May need to wait for Electron or macOS updates

2025-07-25 23:58: Menubar App Development & Debugging Session
------------------------------------------------------------
Work completed:
- Successfully created working macOS menubar app with Electron
- Resolved multiple critical issues preventing menubar functionality
- Cleaned up unnecessary files from failed approaches

CRITICAL DEBUGGING FINDINGS:

1. Electron Tray Icon Issues on macOS 15.5 (Sequoia):
   - Standard icon loading methods fail with "invalid icon" errors
   - Solution: Use empty nativeImage with setTitle('MB') for text display
   - Icon files cause crashes even when properly formatted

2. Electron Version Compatibility:
   - Electron 37.x causes crashes after ~10 seconds on macOS 15.5
   - Solution: Downgrade to Electron 28.3.3 for stability
   - Version 28.x works reliably without timeout crashes

3. Window Resizing Crashes:
   - Any window resize operation causes immediate app crash
   - Solution: Set resizable: false and all related properties
   - Must disable: resizable, minimizable, maximizable, fullscreenable

4. Working Configuration:
   - Window size: 380x520 (fits all content without scrolling)
   - Use empty image for tray: nativeImage.createEmpty()
   - Use tray.setTitle('MB') instead of icon
   - Keep app alive with setInterval(() => {}, 1000)

Approaches Tried (Failed):
- Tauri framework - tray icon issues, complex setup
- menubar npm package - incompatible with newer Electron
- Various icon formats (PNG, template images) - all crash
- Electron 37.x - timeout crashes after 10 seconds

Files Removed:
- src-tauri/ directory (Tauri attempt)
- scripts/ directory (unused)
- Various test files (electron-alternative.js, test.html, etc.)
- Debug and log files

Final Working Structure:
- electron/main.js - Minimal working menubar app
- Simple configuration without complex features
- Text-based menubar icon ('MB')
- Stable window management

Next priority tasks:
- Implement proper icon support when macOS compatibility improves
- Add data persistence (electron-store)
- Enhance security with contextBridge
- Build production version
- CRITICAL: Make app packable and transferable to any Mac (Epic #7)
- Future: Add Windows support for cross-platform distribution

Next priority tasks:
GitHub Issues (Priority):
[CRITICAL] - #1: [EPIC] Core Infrastructure & Security
[HIGH]     - #2: Implement secure Electron preload script with contextBridge
[HIGH]     - #3: Set up electron-store for data persistence
[HIGH]     - #4: Create IPC communication layer for main/renderer
[HIGH]     - #5: Add Content Security Policy (CSP)
[HIGH]     - #6: Remove nodeIntegration and enable contextIsolation

Development approach:
- Start with Epic #1 to establish secure foundation
- Current implementation has critical security vulnerabilities
- Must implement contextBridge and remove nodeIntegration
- Add data persistence before implementing features

Suggested next steps:
1. Create feature branch for Epic #1: `git checkout -b feat/core-infrastructure`
2. Begin with issue #2 - preload script implementation
3. Set up basic testing infrastructure early
4. Document architectural decisions as we go
