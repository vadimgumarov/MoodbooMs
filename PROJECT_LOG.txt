PROJECT WORK LOG - MoodbooM
===================================

2025-08-01 17:13: Epic #53 - Application Modularity COMPLETED
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Successfully implemented complete application modularity system:

Child Issues Completed:
- Issue #96: Module system foundation (Context, Registry, Provider)
- Issue #95: Core modules implementation (Mood, Calendar, History, PhaseDetail)
- Issue #94: Comprehensive module settings panel
- Issue #93: Dynamic tab system based on active modules

Major Achievements:
- Users can enable/disable features at runtime without restart
- Dynamic tab navigation adapts to enabled modules
- Module dependencies and relationships properly managed
- Settings panel with visual module management
- Full keyboard navigation and accessibility support

Technical Implementation:
- React Context for module state management
- Module Registry pattern for centralized control
- Electron-store persistence for module preferences
- Real-time UI updates when modules change
- Proper dependency validation and warnings

UI/UX Improvements:
- Module toggles with clear visual feedback
- Dependency warnings prevent invalid configurations
- Reset to defaults option for quick recovery
- Improved calendar layout and spacing
- Added labels to date inputs for clarity

Benefits Delivered:
- Personalized app experience without complexity
- Start simple, add features as needed
- Better performance with selective features
- Clean, maintainable architecture

2025-07-31 15:36: Issue #95 - Implement Core Modules COMPLETED
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Successfully converted all core tabs to modular components:

Implementation:
- Created MoodModule: Encapsulated Today tab functionality
- Created CalendarModule: Modular calendar with conditional PhaseDetail
- Created HistoryModule: Wrapped cycle history functionality
- Dynamic Tab Navigation: Tabs appear/disappear based on enabled modules
- Fixed Render Loops: Used memoization and proper dependencies

Technical Improvements:
- Fixed infinite re-render caused by availableTabs.join() dependency
- Added useMemo for tab calculation to prevent unnecessary re-renders
- Positioned tooltips below toggle to avoid UI obstruction
- Maintained all existing functionality while adding modularity

Testing Results:
- All modules load correctly when enabled
- Disabling modules removes their tabs immediately
- Module state persists across app restarts
- No performance degradation detected

2025-07-31 15:22: GitHub Workflow Automation - Issue Status Updates
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Enhanced start.sh and finish.sh scripts with automatic project board updates:

Implementation:
- start.sh: Updates issue status to "In Progress" when starting work
- finish.sh: Updates issue status to "Done" when completing work
- Uses GitHub CLI to interact with project board API
- Handles cases where issues aren't in project board gracefully

Technical Details:
- Project ID: PVT_kwHOAVLXms4A-2sf
- Field ID: PVTSSF_lAHOAVLXms4A-2sfzgyIiHA
- Status IDs: Todo (f75ca5e), In Progress (47fc9ee4), Done (98236657)

Benefits:
- Automatic tracking of work progress on GitHub
- No manual board updates needed
- Visual progress tracking for project management

2025-07-31 14:36: Issue #96 - Module System Foundation COMPLETED
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Created comprehensive module system architecture:

Architecture:
- ModuleContext: React Context for module state management
- ModuleRegistry: Centralized registry for all modules
- Module Types: Defined constants and interfaces
- Persistence: Automatic saving to electron-store

Key Features:
- Enable/disable modules at runtime
- Dependency validation and management
- State persistence across sessions
- Clean API for component integration

Testing:
- Created test script to verify module operations
- All CRUD operations working correctly
- Dependencies properly enforced
- State persistence validated

This foundation enables the full modular architecture for MoodbooM.

2025-07-31 06:49: Epic #68 - Modular Queen/King Architecture COMPLETED
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Successfully implemented complete modular architecture with Queen/King modes!

Final Implementation Summary:
- Complete separation of Queen/King modes into distinct modules
- Mode-specific themes with dynamic CSS variable system
- Plugin architecture for mode-specific extensions
- Smooth transitions between modes
- Fixed all theme application issues

Issues Completed:
