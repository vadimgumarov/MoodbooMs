Next priority tasks:
GitHub Issues (Priority):
[CRITICAL] - #1: [EPIC] Core Infrastructure & Security
[HIGH]     - #2: Implement secure Electron preload script with contextBridge
[HIGH]     - #3: Set up electron-store for data persistence
[HIGH]     - #4: Create IPC communication layer for main/renderer
[HIGH]     - #5: Add Content Security Policy (CSP)
[HIGH]     - #6: Remove nodeIntegration and enable contextIsolation

Development approach:
- Start with Epic #1 to establish secure foundation
- Current implementation has critical security vulnerabilities
- Must implement contextBridge and remove nodeIntegration
- Add data persistence before implementing features

Suggested next steps:
1. Create feature branch for Epic #1: `git checkout -b feat/core-infrastructure`
2. Begin with issue #2 - preload script implementation
3. Set up basic testing infrastructure early
4. Document architectural decisions as we go
