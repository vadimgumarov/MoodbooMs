PROJECT WORK LOG - MoodBooMs
===================================

2025-07-26 13:03: Implemented Content Security Policy (Issue #5)
------------------------------------------------------------
Added comprehensive CSP to prevent XSS attacks and control resource loading:

Implementation Details:
- Created csp-config.js with environment-specific policies
- Applied CSP headers via Electron session.webRequest
- Added CSP violation capture and reporting
- Implemented different policies for dev/prod environments

Security Policies:
- Production: Strict self-only policy with minimal exceptions
- Development: Allows localhost and eval for hot reload
- Both allow 'unsafe-inline' styles for Tailwind CSS
- Data URIs permitted for inline images

Key Features:
- Automatic environment detection
- CSP violation reporting to main process
- Comprehensive test suite for policy validation
- Detailed documentation of security choices

Technical Decisions:
- 'unsafe-inline' for styles: Required by Tailwind CSS
- data: URIs: Needed for programmatic icon generation
- No 'unsafe-eval' in production
- WebSocket allowed in dev for hot module replacement

Testing:
- Created csp-test.js to verify policy enforcement
- Tests blocking of inline scripts, external resources
- Validates allowed resources work correctly
- Checks proper CSP header formatting

Documentation:
- CSP_DOCUMENTATION.md with complete implementation guide
- Security considerations and rationale
- Troubleshooting guide for common issues
- Monitoring and maintenance procedures

Result: Robust CSP implementation that protects against XSS while maintaining app functionality.

Next Steps:
- Complete Epic #1 with issue #6
- Remove nodeIntegration (already done, needs verification)
- Begin Epic #7: Calendar & Date Calculations

2025-07-26 12:47: Created Comprehensive IPC Communication Layer (Issue #4)
------------------------------------------------------------
Designed and implemented a robust IPC layer with proper structure and conventions:

Implementation Details:
- Created ipc-channels.js with centralized channel definitions
- Implemented naming convention: domain:action-target
- Built ipcHandlersV2.js with error handling middleware
- Added all required cycle-specific channels
- Created preloadV2.js with organized API structure

Key Features:
- Consistent channel naming across entire application
- Comprehensive error handling with IPCError class
- Parameter validation for all IPC handlers
- Backward compatibility with existing store operations
- Development-only channels for debugging

Documentation:
- IPC_DOCUMENTATION.md - Complete channel reference
- IPC_MIGRATION.md - Step-by-step migration guide
- TypeScript definitions in src/types/ipc.d.ts
- Test suite in tests/electron/ipc-tests.js

Channel Categories:
- Cycle operations (get-data, save-data, get-history, add-history)
- Settings management (get, set, reset, get-all)
- Window control (minimize, maximize, hide, show, position)
- System information (platform, locale, theme)
- App operations (version, updates, quit, restart)
- Notifications, dialogs, and development tools

Technical Improvements:
- Error codes: IPC_INVALID_PARAMS, IPC_HANDLER_ERROR, etc.
- Validation middleware for parameter checking
- Async/await pattern throughout
- Grouped channels by feature domain
- Migration map for old channel names

Result: A professional, maintainable IPC layer that provides secure communication between main and renderer processes with excellent developer experience.

Next Steps:
- Migrate existing code to use new IPC layer
- Continue with Epic #1 security issues
- Issue #5: Add Content Security Policy
- Issue #6: Remove nodeIntegration

2025-07-26 12:30: Implemented Secure Data Persistence (Issue #3)
------------------------------------------------------------
Successfully implemented electron-store for secure data persistence:

Implementation Details:
- Installed electron-store@8.1.0 (CommonJS version for compatibility)
- Created comprehensive store.js module with schema validation
- Integrated store operations into IPC handlers
- Connected React app to use persistent storage

Data Schema:
- cycleData: Start date, cycle length (21-35 days), history tracking
- preferences: Notifications, theme, language, test mode
- appState: Version, last opened, onboarding status

Key Features:
- Automatic data validation before saving
- Encrypted storage for security
- Cycle history tracking (keeps last 12 cycles)
- Export/import functionality for data backup
- Merge updates to preserve existing data

Technical Discoveries:
- electron-store v10+ is ESM-only, incompatible with current setup
- Downgraded to v8.1.0 for CommonJS compatibility
- Store can only be used in Electron context, not Node.js
- All store access must go through IPC handlers

Files Added/Modified:
- electron/store.js (new - complete store implementation)
- electron/ipcHandlers.js (connected store operations)
- src/components/MenuBarApp.jsx (added persistence on data changes)
- tests/electron/test-store-electron.js (new - Electron tests)
- CLAUDE.md (documented store implementation)

Testing:
- Created comprehensive test suite
- Verified data persists across app restarts
- Validated all schema constraints working
- Export/import functionality tested

Result: User cycle data and preferences now persist between app sessions, providing a seamless experience.

Next Steps:
- Continue with Epic #1 security issues
- Issue #4: Create IPC communication layer (partially done)
- Issue #5: Add Content Security Policy

2025-07-26 11:37: Implemented Dynamic Weather Icons (Issue #15)
------------------------------------------------------------
Successfully implemented dynamic tray icons that change based on cycle phase:

Implementation Details:
- Created IconGeneratorLucide.js for weather-themed icons
- Built TrayManager.js to handle icon updates
- Added IPC communication via preload.js
- React component sends phase updates to main process

Icon Mapping:
- Sun ‚òÄÔ∏è - "Finally Got My Sh*t Together" (follicular)
- Cloud+Sun üå§Ô∏è - "Horny AF" (ovulation)
- Cloud ‚òÅÔ∏è - "Getting Real Tired of This BS" (early luteal)
- Cloud+Rain üåßÔ∏è - "Pre-Chaos Mood Swings" (late luteal)
- Cloud+Lightning ‚õàÔ∏è - "Bloody Hell Week" (menstruation)
- Tornado üå™Ô∏è - "Apocalypse Countdown" (PMS)

Technical Discoveries:
- PNG loading still fails on macOS 15.5
- Programmatic icon generation works reliably
- 22x22 size optimal for macOS menubar
- 2x resolution improves quality on retina displays
- Simple shapes more effective than complex details

Files Added/Modified:
- electron/iconGeneratorLucide.js (new)
- electron/trayManager.js (new)
- electron/preload.js (new)
- electron/main.js (modified for IPC)
- src/components/MenuBarApp.jsx (added phase updates)
- CLAUDE.md (documented solutions)
- README.md (added feature description)

Result: Menubar icon now dynamically changes from sunny to stormy weather based on menstrual cycle phase, providing visual feedback at a glance.

Next Steps:
- Further icon refinements for better clarity
- Add icon animations/transitions
- Support for dark/light mode themes

2025-07-26 10:42: Fixed Menubar Icon and Pushed to Main
------------------------------------------------------------
Completed icon fix implementation and merged to main branch:

Git Commit: 6323a6b
Message: "fix: implement stable programmatic icon for macOS 15.5 menubar"
- Merged fix-menubar-icon branch to main
- Pushed changes to GitHub repository
- Resolves issue #49

Next Steps:

- Part of Epic #13: Dynamic UI & Tray Icons
- Create feature branch for dynamic icon implementation

2025-07-26 10:29: Resolved Menubar Icon Crashes on macOS 15.5
------------------------------------------------------------
Successfully implemented stable icon solution for macOS Sequoia:

Problem:
- VS Code and app crashed when attempting to load PNG icons
- All PNG file loading methods resulted in empty icons
- macOS 15.5 has compatibility issues with standard icon loading

Solution Implemented:
- Created programmatic icon generation in electron/main.js
- Draws a 16x16 purple/pink circle icon in memory
- Bypasses file loading entirely using Buffer and nativeImage
- Multiple fallback strategies ensure app always starts

Technical Details:
- Primary: Try loading PNG files (for future compatibility)
- Secondary: Create colored circle icon programmatically
- Tertiary: Fall back to text-only "MB" if needed
- Added comprehensive error handling and logging

Result:
- App runs stably with visible menubar icon
- No more crashes on icon loading
- Icon appears as purple/pink circle in menubar
- Solution documented in CLAUDE.md for future reference

Files Modified:
- electron/main.js - Implemented programmatic icon generation
- CLAUDE.md - Added working icon solution documentation

2025-07-26 07:56: Project Structure Refactoring
------------------------------------------------------------
Reorganized project for better maintainability:

Created folder structure:
- /electron/assets/icons - Production icon files
- /tests/electron - Electron-specific test files
- /tests/unit - Unit tests
- /tests/integration - Integration tests
- /temp - Temporary files and experiments (gitignored)
- /logs - Log files (gitignored)

Actions taken:
- Moved all test files from electron/ to tests/electron/
- Moved all icon files to electron/assets/icons/
- Moved log files to logs/
- Updated .gitignore to exclude temp/ and logs/
- Added README files to test directories
- Updated main.js with comment about icon path

Result: Clean separation between production code and tests

2025-07-26 07:52: Tray Icon Investigation
------------------------------------------------------------
Investigation into why icons don't work on macOS 15.5:
- Confirmed this is a macOS Sequoia (15.x) compatibility issue
- All image loading methods fail (direct path, nativeImage, base64)
- Icons always return empty (0x0 size) even for valid PNG files
- User briefly saw question mark icon (macOS's missing icon indicator)
- System refuses to load any image files for tray icons
- Created GitHub issue #49 to track this problem

Findings:
- This appears to be an OS-level restriction/bug
- Other Electron apps also affected (1Password, etc.)
- Only workaround is text-based tray using setTitle()
- May need to wait for Electron or macOS updates

2025-07-25 23:58: Menubar App Development & Debugging Session
------------------------------------------------------------
Work completed:
- Successfully created working macOS menubar app with Electron
- Resolved multiple critical issues preventing menubar functionality
- Cleaned up unnecessary files from failed approaches

CRITICAL DEBUGGING FINDINGS:

1. Electron Tray Icon Issues on macOS 15.5 (Sequoia):
   - Standard icon loading methods fail with "invalid icon" errors
   - Solution: Use empty nativeImage with setTitle('MB') for text display
   - Icon files cause crashes even when properly formatted

2. Electron Version Compatibility:
   - Electron 37.x causes crashes after ~10 seconds on macOS 15.5
   - Solution: Downgrade to Electron 28.3.3 for stability
   - Version 28.x works reliably without timeout crashes

3. Window Resizing Crashes:
   - Any window resize operation causes immediate app crash
   - Solution: Set resizable: false and all related properties
   - Must disable: resizable, minimizable, maximizable, fullscreenable

4. Working Configuration:
   - Window size: 380x520 (fits all content without scrolling)
   - Use empty image for tray: nativeImage.createEmpty()
   - Use tray.setTitle('MB') instead of icon
   - Keep app alive with setInterval(() => {}, 1000)

Approaches Tried (Failed):
- Tauri framework - tray icon issues, complex setup
- menubar npm package - incompatible with newer Electron
- Various icon formats (PNG, template images) - all crash
- Electron 37.x - timeout crashes after 10 seconds

Files Removed:
- src-tauri/ directory (Tauri attempt)
- scripts/ directory (unused)
- Various test files (electron-alternative.js, test.html, etc.)
- Debug and log files

Final Working Structure:
- electron/main.js - Minimal working menubar app
- Simple configuration without complex features
- Text-based menubar icon ('MB')
- Stable window management

Next priority tasks:
- Implement proper icon support when macOS compatibility improves
- Add data persistence (electron-store)
- Enhance security with contextBridge
- Build production version
- CRITICAL: Make app packable and transferable to any Mac (Epic #7)
- Future: Add Windows support for cross-platform distribution
