- Medium complexity - manageable scope
- Must be done before modularity epic

**Key Deliverables:**
- Mode selection screen for first launch
- Professional (Mode A) content implementation
- Badass (Mode B) content enhancement
- Settings integration for mode switching
- Content service architecture

---

### 2. Epic #31: Testing & Quality Assurance
**Timeline:** 1 week

**Why Second:**
- Critical for app stability before distribution
- Tests all existing features including new experience modes
- Reduces bugs before production release
- Foundation for confident deployment

**Key Deliverables:**
- Unit tests for cycle calculations
- Component tests for UI elements
- E2E tests for critical flows
- Performance monitoring
- Test coverage > 80%

---

### 3. Epic #25: Production Build & Distribution
**Timeline:** 1 week

**Why Third:**
- Needs solid testing foundation
- Required before cross-platform work
- Enables initial macOS distribution
- Sets up update mechanisms

**Key Deliverables:**
- Electron-builder configuration
- Auto-updater functionality
- Code signing setup
- Distribution pipeline
- Error tracking integration

---

### 4. Epic #43: Cross-Platform Packaging
**Timeline:** 2-3 weeks

**Why Fourth:**
- Depends on production build setup
- Expands market reach significantly
- High complexity needs stable base
- Builds on distribution infrastructure

**Key Deliverables:**
- macOS DMG/ZIP distribution
- Universal binary (Intel + Apple Silicon)
- Windows build support
- Portable versions
- CI/CD pipeline

---

### 5. Epic #52: Enhanced Navigation & Date Selection
**Timeline:** 1 week

**Why Fifth:**
- Nice-to-have features
- Low complexity additions
- Can be done independently
- Improves UX incrementally

**Key Deliverables:**
- Advanced date navigation
- Quick date selection
- Improved calendar controls
- Better phase navigation

---

### 6. Epic #53: Application Modularity & User Customization
**Timeline:** 2-3 weeks

**Why Last:**
- Most complex architectural change
- Depends on experience modes being stable
- Lower immediate user value
- Can be future enhancement

**Key Deliverables:**
- Module system architecture
- Dynamic UI based on enabled modules
- Module preferences in settings
- Compact mode options

## Implementation Strategies

### Quick Wins Path (3-4 weeks)
**Epic #59 → #31 → #25** = Core app ready for distribution

### Full Feature Path (8-10 weeks)
**All epics** = Complete feature set with cross-platform support

### Parallel Work Opportunities
- Documentation can be updated during any epic
- Testing can begin while implementing features
- Design work for future epics during current implementation

## Risk Mitigation

1. **Content Complexity (Epic #59)**
   - Start with MVP content sets
   - Iterate based on user feedback
   - Keep content structure flexible

2. **Cross-Platform Issues (Epic #43)**
   - Test early on multiple OS versions
   - Have fallback distribution methods
   - Consider platform-specific features

3. **Performance Concerns (Epic #53)**
   - Profile before and after changes
   - Implement lazy loading
   - Keep module boundaries clean

## Next Steps

1. **Immediate:** Start Epic #59 - Create mode selection screen
2. **This Week:** Complete initial content mapping for both modes
3. **Next Week:** Implement content service and mode switching
4. **Following:** Move to Epic #31 for comprehensive testing
