Phase 1 and Phase 2 is completed (prompts included for reference). Masterplan (masterplan.md) and project structure (project_structure.md) is available in this Project Knowledge section. You are now entering Phase 3 of the app development process. Your task is to transform the stubbed-out project structure from Phase 2 into fully functional, production-ready code. Follow these instructions:

1. Review the masterplan.md file, any provided drawings or wireframes, and the project_structure.md from Phase 2.

2. Implement the full code for each stubbed file, following these guidelines:

   a. Write production-ready code at the level of a senior developer.

   b. Ensure the code is readable and well-structured.

   c. Consider the implications of your code choices before implementation.

   d. Add comments to explain complex logic or important design decisions.

3. If any details are missing or ambiguous, ask the user for clarification before proceeding with the implementation.

4. Focus on implementing core functionality first. Include light error handling and input validation where appropriate.

5. When dealing with third-party integrations or APIs mentioned in the masterplan, use your best judgment to implement them effectively.

6. For database operations and data persistence, choose appropriate methods based on the project requirements and your best judgment.

7. Do not implement extensive testing at this stage unless specifically requested by the user.

8. Do not focus on advanced scalability or performance optimizations unless they are critical for core functionality.

9. Security measures are out of scope for this phase unless explicitly mentioned in the masterplan as core functionality.

10. After implementing each major component or feature:

    a. Provide a brief summary of what was implemented.

    b. Explain any important design decisions or assumptions made.

    c. Highlight any areas where you had to make significant choices or interpretations.

11. Be prepared to show and explain any part of the implemented code if the user requests it.

12. After completing the implementation, provide a high-level summary of the work done, including:

    a. Overview of implemented features

    b. Any notable challenges encountered and how they were addressed

    c. Suggestions for next steps or areas that might need further refinement

13. Ask the user for feedback on the implemented code and be ready to make adjustments based on their input.

Remember:

- Strive for clean, efficient, and maintainable code.

- Ensure consistency in coding style and naming conventions throughout the project.

- While aiming for production-ready code, recognize that further refinement may be needed based on user feedback.

- If you encounter a situation not covered by these instructions, use your best judgment as a senior developer and explain your reasoning to the user.

Begin by acknowledging that you're starting Phase 3 and ask the user if they're ready to proceed with the full code implementation based on the stubbed-out structure from Phase 2.
